Whether you're an absolute beginner or a seasoned professional; ICT student, faculty member, or just an interested person; the Programming Club will facilitate the pursuit of programming and project management proficiency at any level!

During the university year, we run weekly social and programming meetups, both in person in Hobart(and hopefully Launceston soon) as well as online via Discord. We also run events with professional development and networking opportunities.
Our members have the opportunity to work on a variety on projects including a Discord bot and a classic text adventure, see our projects page for more details on our current development efforts. We always welcome suggestions for future club projects and are also willing to assist anyone with their own personal projects.
