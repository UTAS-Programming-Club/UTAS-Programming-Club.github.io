title: About Us
---

We are a group of students who are passionate about programming and want to share our knowledge with others. The club is open to all students at UTAS, regardless of your experience level. We also welcome programmers from other universities and the community! We meet every week to work on projects, learn new skills, and have fun!

To focus our learning and efforts, the Club runs some projects. Open to members, we aim to push people to improve while keeping projects accessible for people of varying skill.
