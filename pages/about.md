title: About Us
---

We are a group of students who are passionate about programming and want to share our knowledge with others. The club is open to all students at UTAS, regardless of your experience level. We also welcome programmers from other universities and the community! We meet every week to work on projects, learn new skills, and have fun!

To focus our learning and efforts, the Club runs various projects which members are encouraged to contribute to. See the projects page for more details. Our main aim is to push people to improve while keeping projects accessible for people with varying skill levels and abilities.

If anyone has any questions for the Club, please send us a message via either Discord or [Email](mailto: contact@programmingclub.com.au).
