The Club runs a series of programming projects to encourage learning and to build stuff together. Organised from the bottom up, these projects are a way to apply skills and concepts from class and outside university in a friendly and supportive environment. We aim to design projects to be accessible for people of varying skill. Projects are open to all members.
