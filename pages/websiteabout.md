This is a preview of the Programming Club's redesigned website.  
Designed by Kentaro Watts.  
Implemented by Joshua Wierenga and Kentaro Watts.  

This website relies of [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/), licensed under [MIT](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v5.3.3/LICENSE) 
and various icons from [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/), also licensed under [MIT](https://github.com/twbs/icons/blob/v1.11.3/LICENSE).  
Special thanks to Nathaniel for their css only dark mode toggle [code](https://endtimes.dev/no-javascript-dark-mode-toggle/).
